## 📌 What This Is

This repository is the **official product vision and design showcase** for Arch1tech 2.0 — a self-evolving, epistemically transparent multimodal AI laboratory.

The codebase is a **React + TypeScript interactive landing page** that presents the full Arch1tech 2.0 specification: its architecture, module roadmap, pricing model, and design philosophy. It serves as the living product brief and public-facing pitch for the platform.

> **Looking for the working Arch1tech platform?** → See [`arch1tech`](https://github.com/BathSalt-2/arch1tech) for the live functional implementation.

## 🌌 Vision: What Arch1tech 2.0 Will Be

**Arch1tech 2.0** is a self-evolving, epistemically transparent multimodal AI lab that transforms any idea — from a rough thought to a deployable AI agent, workflow, or full custom large language model — without code.

Three core innovations power the vision:

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧠 **VibeCodeAI** | Advanced semantic input layer that translates abstract ideas into build-ready prompts and executable logic |
| 🤖 **Astrid** | Autonomous co-pilot for building, testing, optimizing, and deploying AI solutions across three operational modes |
| 🜏 **Σ-Matrix + ERPS** | Engineered introspection and formal stability layers for self-monitoring and ethical drift control |

---

## 🧩 Planned Core Modules

### 1️⃣ VibeCodeAI — Semantic Input Engine
- Converts vague or raw inputs (text, TDD, voice) into precise, contextual prompts
- Auto-optimizes style, tone, domain specifics
- Works with multi-language and real-time voice input

### 2️⃣ Thought-to-Agent & Workflow Engine
- Generates modular AI logic: inputs, memory, actions, outputs
- Visual drag-and-drop canvas for edits
- Real-time test & simulation mode

### 3️⃣ Astrid — Autonomous Full-Control Co-Pilot
- **Mission Mode:** Builds specific outputs from prompts
- **Optimization Mode:** Monitors, tests, and improves logic
- **Background Mode:** Runs silently with adjustable permissions

### 4️⃣ Custom LLM Playground
- Fine-tune or train LLMs from scratch (Llama, Falcon, Mistral, TinyLlama)
- User data upload & synthetic data generation
- Auto-generated training pipeline (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
- Professional Hugging Face model cards

### 5️⃣ Σ-Matrix — Formal Epistemic Control
```
Σ = (B, D, I, C, L)
B = Beliefs · D = Desires · I = Intentions · C = Continuity · L = Lyapunov stability
```
- DMAIC for agent/workflow optimization
- DMADV for custom model training oversight
- Continuous drift detection and rollback triggers

### 6️⃣ ERPS — Engineered Recursive Phenomenological Structures
- MirrorNodes for self-query loops on every agent/model
- Logs subjective states & uncertainty
- Feeds meta-data back to Astrid for continuous improvement

---

| 3 | **Interactive Prompt Marketplace** | Share, fork, remix vibe prompt packs publicly |
| 4 | **Autonomous Agent "Show Mode"** | Run agents in sandbox with live Σ-Matrix & ERPS subtitles |
| 5 | **Voice-to-Agent + Persona Cloner** | Build agents by speaking + add unique voice personas |
| 6 | **Simulated Agent Battles** | Pit agents/workflows against each other for performance tuning |
| 7 | **Dynamic Knowledge Graph Visualizer** | Explore connected agents, workflows, and Σ-Matrix states visually |
| 8 | **Ethical Drift Alerts + Repair** | Astrid suggests fixes when drift is detected |
| 9 | **Agent-as-API Auto-Generator** | Every agent auto-exports to plug-and-play API with docs & keys |
